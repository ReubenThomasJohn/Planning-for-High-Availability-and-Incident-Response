| Availability | The associated Service Level Indicator (SLI) for a Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99% availability would be the uptime percentage of the service or system being monitored. If the SLO is 99% availability, then the SLI would be a measurement of the uptime percentage, with a target of 99% or higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | no. of successful requests / total no. of requests                                                                                                        |
| Latency      | This Service Level Objective (SLO) states that 90% of all requests made to the system or service should have a response time of less than 100 milliseconds. This means that for every 100 requests made, 90 of them should be completed within 100 milliseconds or less. This SLO is a performance metric that aims to ensure that the system or service is responding quickly and efficiently to user requests.                                                                                                                                                                      | Histogram buckets showing 90th percentile of time taken for requests       | 90% of requests below 100ms                                                                                 |
| Error Budget | This Service Level Objective (SLO) states that the system or service has an "error budget" of 20%. This means that 20% of all requests made to the system or service can fail without the system or service being considered to be in violation of the SLO. This means that for every 100 requests made, 20 of them can fail without the system or service being deemed as not meeting the SLO. This SLO is a measure of the system or service's reliability, and it helps ensure that users can still access the system or service even if a certain number of requests fail.        | Percentage of the error budget remaining               | Error budget is defined at 20%. This means that 20% of the requests can fail and still be within the budget |
| Throughput   | This Service Level Objective (SLO) states that the system or service is considered to be functioning when it is handling an average of at least 5 requests per second. This means that the system or service should be able to handle an average of 5 requests every second over a rolling 30-day period. This SLO is a measure of the system or service's performance, and it ensures that the system or service can handle a sufficient number of requests in a given period of time. This SLO is a measure of the system or service's ability to handle the expected traffic load. | Sum of number of successful requests
